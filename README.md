# Scraper di Borsa
This repository contain a scraper procedure to collect few public data from the website of [Borsa Italiana](https://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsa/azioni/listino-a-z.html?initial=A). The goal is to scrape the maximal and minimal values of a list of company titles and store them on local file.

The code could simply be runned periodically (i.e. each day) with a wrapper method placed on a server or online platform such as [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).

Feel free to use it if you need it.
